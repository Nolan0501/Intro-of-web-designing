Self-Introdction

Hello!I'm Nola Zheng.
I'm glad that I've found such a great website of building software and I'd like to share my experience here with everyone.

Actually,I'm also new to web designing.But I found that I'm interested in programming.
So my first project is my own website which records my own experience in high school and my thoughts towards new things.

My name is Nola Zheng.
I live in Shanghai and I study in Ulink Cambridge International Centre Shanghai for Secondary Education.
I desperately want to study EE/ME/CS in US university.

I set up a club called 'Hackerspace for Engineering' in CIC.
My plan for next term to the club is to start some workshops making things with Arduino or web designing.

If you are also high school makers or who would like to organize activities in CIC,please contact me.
